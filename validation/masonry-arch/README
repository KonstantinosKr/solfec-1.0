Analysis:
  Explicit dynamics, frictional contact.

Purpose:
  Examine applicability of the dynamic scheme to the limit-state analysis of frictional block structures.

Summary:
  A semicircular arch is composed of 27 blocks, subjected to the uniform gravitational field. The dynamic
  stability of the arch is investigated for varying ratios of the thickness to centreline radius h/r.
  The results are compared against the available findings based on the limit-state analysis.
