Analysis:
  Explicit dynamics, unconstrained linear motion.

Purpose:
  Examine the accuracy of integration of the linear motion.

Summary:
  A projectile is subjected to gravity and air resistance loading. The total
  travel time and travel distance are calculated for an assumed initial velocity
  and air resistance proportionality constant, k.
