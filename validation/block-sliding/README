  method for integrating stiff multibody dynamics with contact, joints, and friction. International

Analysis:
  Explicit dynamics, frictional stick-slip transition.

Purpose:
  Examine the accuracy of an analysis involving persistent contact and stick-slip transition.

Summary:
  A block subjected to a sinusoidal force slips over a frictional surface. Position and velocity
  plots are compared against those available in the source paper.
