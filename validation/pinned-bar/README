Analysis:
  Explicit dynamics, bilaterally constrained motion.

Purpose:
  Examine the accuracy of an analysis involving spherical joints.

Summary:
  A homogeneous bar, pinned at a distance a from one end, with total length L,
  is subjected to gravity loading and released from rest at an angle theta=30 deg
  from the vertical. The rotational speed when it passes through theta=0 deg is
  calculated and compared to an analytical expression.
