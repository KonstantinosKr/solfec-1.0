Analysis:
  Explicit dynamics, forced, unconstrained rotation.

Purpose:
  Examine stability and accuracy of the integration scheme in the presence of severe
  geometrical nonlinearity.

Summary:
  The heavy symmetrical top is spinning around the 􏰜xed point O. In this ex- ample the applied
  torque depends on the con􏰜guration, introducing additional source of nonlinearity. As the torque
  does not depend on the time step, the second order accuracy can be exempli􏰜ed.
