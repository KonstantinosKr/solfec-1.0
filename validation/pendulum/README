Analysis:
  Explicit dynamics, bilaterally constrained motion.

Purpose:
  Examine the accuracy of an analysis involving rigid rod constraint.

Summary:
  A mathematical pendulum composed of a mass point and a weightless rod swings
  with a large amplitude. Pendulum period, energy conservation, constraint
  satisfaction and convergence are examined.
