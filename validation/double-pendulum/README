Analysis:
  Explicit dynamics, frictionless impact, bilateral constraints.

Purpose:
  Examine the accuracy of an analysis involving frictionless impact and bilateral constraints.

Summary:
  A double pendulum composed of two mass points connected by weightless rods impacts a rigid wall.
  Position and energy plots are compared against those available in the source paper.
