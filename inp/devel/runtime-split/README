Demonstration of runtime mesh splitting via RT_SPLIT command
invoked from a callback function;

Two elastic pipes impact a flat base and fragment based on pre-set,
time-based triggers; One pipe develops a "single-crack" first, without
fragmenting, and then develops another "crack" and fragments in two;
The other pipe fragments in two pieces after a single call to RT_SPLIT;
