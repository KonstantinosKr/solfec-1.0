This is a two-body vibration test of the HYBRID_SOLVER in Solfec;
The problem geometry is:

The plate is held by two damped springs and it is modeled in Parmec;
The U-shaped body is vibrated at both of the far-x low-y corners and it
is modeled in Solfec; The plate is rigid; the U-body is elastic;
Contact between the plate and the U-body is modeled as non-smooth in
Solfec; Body dimensions are in the range of tens of centimeters;
There is a gap between the plate and the U-shaped body in the range
of one millimeter; Details can be found in the input files.

This example is prepared with the intention of testing the stability
of the hybrid time stepping scheme.
