An elastic pipe free falls onto a block obstacle. The inner pipe radius is 0.01 m, its thickness
is 0.005 m, and its length is 0.1 m. The pipe lowest point is initially located 0.025 m above the
top surface of the block. Point p0 impacts the geometrical center of the block. Points p0 is 025 m
away from the left end of the pipe. The pipe is made of 36x36x4 fully integrated trilinear hexahedral
elements. The elastic properties of the pipe are E=1E7 Pa, nu=0.25 and its density is rho=1E3 kg/m^3.
The obstacle has dimensions 0.01x0.1x0.01 m and it is modeled as a geometrical boundary which does not
contribute mass. The gravity along the z-direction is -10 m/s^2. The simulation time step is 0.001 s,
the duration is 0.1 s, and the amount of damping is eta=1E-4. Schemes TL, BC, and BC-RO are compared:

 * Total Lagrangian (TL)
 * Body co-rotational (BC)
 * Body co-rotation reduced order (BC-RO)

100 co-rotated displacement samples from the Total Lagrangian solution and 6 rigid motion modes are
used as input for the Python modred package (http://pythonhosted.org/modred/), to produce 18 Proper
Orthogonal Decomposition modes for the BC-RO approach.
