This is a 1D array acceleration dwell test of the HYBRID_SOLVER in Solfec;

We have a 1-dimensional array of 2*M+N cubes:

The first and last M bodies are modeled as rigid in Parmec;
Bodies 1 and 2 in Solfec, corresponding to M-1 and M in Parmec,
are modeled as rigid; These provide coupling with Parmec;
Bodies 3,4,...,N+2 are modeled using finite elements in Solfec;

Bodies are shaped as cubes of dimensions 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 m;
Initial gap between all bodies is 1 mm;

Constant, 1 m/s2, amplitude acceleration dwell signal at 1 Hz
from time 0 to 5 s, is applied to body 0 and 2*M-1 in Parmec;

Body interactions in Parmec are modeled using a unilateral spring-dashpot model:

spring stroke    | -1-gap  | -gap | 1 |
spring stiffness |  -1E3   |  0   | 0 |

normal velocity  | -1 | 1 |
damper constant  | -7 | 7 |

Body interactions in Solfec are modeled by means of the Signorini-Coulomb model,
using the friction coefficient of 0.1 and the velocity restitution coefficient of 0.0;

Bulk material parameters are: density = 100 kg/m3, Young modulus = 1 MPa, Poisson ratio = 0.25;

Solfec time step: 5E-4 s; Parmec time step: 1E-4 s;

Motion along Y and Z directions is restrained; All rotations are restricted in Parmec;
