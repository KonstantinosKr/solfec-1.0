This is a two-body test of the HYBRID_SOLVER in Solfec;
The mechanical problem is:

  +----------+
  |          |  cube 1x1x1m
  |          |  mass density 1 kg/m3
  |          |                           
  |          |                           Z   Y
  +----------+                           |  /         gravity = (0, 0, -10)
   gap = 0.1m                            | /          initial velocities are all zero
  +----------+                           + ----- X
  |          |  cube 1x1x1m                           impact restitution is 0.0 
  |          |  mass density 1 kg/m3                  contact friction of 0.1
  |          |  fixed along X, Y + all rotations      
  |          |
  +----------+
       \
       /  spring stiffness 100 N/m
       \  dashpot coefficient 1 Nm/s
       /
      ===

      the natural frequency of the undamped spring mass is: sqrt(k/m)/2pi = 10/3.14 ~ 3.2 Hz

In Solfec:
  The upper body is modeled as RIGID using 8 hexahedral elements;
  The lower body is modeled as RIGID using one hexahedral element;
  Signorini-Coulomb model is used to model contact interaction;

In Parmec:
  Only the lower body is modeled as a rigid body;
  One hexahedral element is used;

We model vibrations of this impact problem over time [0, 10s];

NOTE: the transitional *boundary* bodies all need to modeled as rigid in Solfec;
