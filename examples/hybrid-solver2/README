This is a 2D array acceleration dwell test of the HYBRID_SOLVER in Solfec;
This is a direct generalization of the 1D array example hybrid-solver1;

We have a 2-dimensional array of (M+N+M)x(M+N+M) cubes:

      M         N        M
     +--+      +--+      +--+
  M  |P | ...  |P |  ... |P |
     +--+      +--+      +--+
     ...       ...       ...
     +--+      +--+      +--+
  N  |P | ...  |S | ...  |P |
     +--+      +--+      +--+
     ...       ...       ...
     +--+      +--+      +--+
  M  |P |      |P |      |P |
     +--+      +--+      +--+


The outer MxM, MxN, NxM sub-arrays are modeled as rigid in Parmec (marekd with "P");
The inner NxN array is modeled using finite elements in Solfec (marekd with "S");
The layer of bodies directly adjacent to the Parmec arrays is modeled in Solfec
using rigid bodies; This layer provides coupling between Solfec and Parmec;

Bodies are shaped as cubes of dimensions 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 m;
Initial gap between all bodies is 1 mm;

Constant, 1 m/s2, amplitude acceleration dwell signal at 1 Hz
from time 0 to 5 s, is applied to the outer shell of bodies in Parmec,
along direction (1, 1, 0);

Body interactions in Parmec are modeled using a unilateral spring-dashpot model:

spring stroke    | -1-gap  | -gap | 1 |
spring stiffness |  -1E3   |  0   | 0 |

normal velocity  | -1 | 1 |
damper constant  | -7 | 7 |

Body interactions in Solfec are modeled by means of the Signorini-Coulomb model,
using the friction coefficient of 0.1 and the velocity restitution coefficient of 0.0;

Bulk material parameters are: density = 100 kg/m3, Young modulus 1 MPa, Poisson ratio = 0.25;

Solfec time step: 5E-4 s; Parmec time step: 1E-4 s;

Motion along the Z direction is restrained; All rotations are restricted in Parmec;
