Reduced order modeling example 0: 81 bricks array
--------------------------------- ===============

The experiment behind this example comes from the context of the civil nuclear power generation
in the UK. A series of dynamic tests were carried out by National Nuclear Corporation in 1985 as
part of the seismic endorsement of the Heysham II / Torness AGRAGR stands for an Advanced
Gass-cooled Reactor core design. These tests used an array of 81 graphite bricks, consisting of
alternating ‘fuel’ and ‘interstitial’ bricks. The array was mounted in a rigid frame on a shaker
table. The boundary frame was driven in the horizontal plane with synthesized seismic or swept-sine
input motions in either one or both axes simultaneously. Measurements were taken of the resulting
velocities of certain bricks in the array (determined from accelerometer data) and also of the
forces within the keying system (using load cells built into some components). Some details of
the experimental setup has been described in [1-2]. We note, that this example is called the
“81 bricks array”, or simply the “81 array”, because the total number of unconstrained fuel and
interstitial bricks is 81.
